# Welcome to My Project 

## Project Info

This project is a modern CV web application built using:

- **Vite** – for fast development and lightning-quick builds  
- **TypeScript** – for type-safe, scalable code  
- **React** – to build powerful, component-based UIs  
- **shadcn-ui** – for accessible, customizable UI components  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first styling that keeps your design clean and responsive  

## Getting Started

Want to run this project locally? Follow the steps below:

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Move into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm i

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
````

Your app will now be live at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Development Workflow

You can use any code editor you like—VS Code is recommended for the best developer experience. Hot reloading is enabled, so you can see your changes instantly as you code.

## Deployment

To deploy this app, you can use platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your own custom hosting setup. Just make sure to build the project before deploying:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then, serve the contents of the `dist` folder.

## Domain Setup

If you’re hosting this on a custom domain, make sure to point your domain's DNS to your chosen deployment platform and follow their instructions for adding a domain.

```

Just replace `<YOUR_GIT_URL>` and `<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` with your actual repository info. Let me know if you'd like a section about what the app *does* or what features it includes!
